# Courtney Worrell Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mina the Ballerina: Choose Your Own Adventure.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Interactive story that takes the reader through the life of a ballerina, and allows them to make some choices of their own. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

"Mina the Ballerina: Choose Your Own Adventure" will be a short story 
made in the Renpy software that will allow the viwer to
make decisions as they travel through the book with the main charcter. 
Each charcter, setting, and audio will be different from one another. 
Ideally, thier will be two different types of actions in this story,
some that have consequences, and some that do not. I hope to use the four 
arrow keys as the decision makers. right to go forward, left to go 
back, up for decion 1, and down for decion 2. I'm not sure how long the 
story will be, but I aim for there to be 10 decisions to make (maybe
3 with consequences that impact the story, the other 7 without).

No.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

- write out my script 
- Using Renpy program 
- finding images for each character
